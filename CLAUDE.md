# TEC System — Claude Code Instructions

> ⚡ **SESSION START:** اقرأ `knowledge-base/C-02___CURRENT_STATE_.md` + **app charter
> `knowledge-base/C-110___SYSTEM_INSTITUTIONAL_CHARTER.md`** من `yasira82/tec-knowledge-base` (branch: `main`).

## What This App Is

**The Constitution Runtime** of the TEC platform (C-110) — the **Institutional
Authority Layer**. C-47 (Kernel Spec) defines the rules; **SYSTEM makes them
queryable, governs subscription tiers, and certifies capabilities (C-94)**. It
answers one question:

```
"Is this actor / operation legitimate under the constitution?"
```

Built from `tec-template-base` (Next.js 15 frontend).

**Current Phase: System V0/V1 — Governance Console (read-only).** Identity / domain /
slug / legal + a **read-only Governance Console**: policy registry (the 10 C-47
Forbidden Behaviors as machine-readable policies), subscription-tier gating map
(FREE/PRO/ENTERPRISE), capability registry (C-94), + a `/policy/[id]` detail page.
Not yet deployed.

> **SYSTEM is admin-first governance, not a consumer app.** Revenue is **indirect**
> (ecosystem trust + subscription-gating enforcement, C-110 §7) — there is **no
> consumer "Pro" payment surface**. The payment scaffold (`src/lib/pi-payment.ts`,
> ADR-007 guard, BFF payment routes) is retained for compliance/optionality only.

## Pi App Identity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **App** | TEC System |
| **Domain** | `https://system.tecosystem.app` |
| **Pi App ID** | ⏳ TBD — register at Pi Developer Portal (if submitted) · then Vercel `NEXT_PUBLIC_PI_APP_ID` |
| **APP_SOURCE slug** | `system` (payment-service resolves `PI_API_KEY_SYSTEM` — only if a payment is ever added) |
| **PI_SANDBOX** | `false` (Mainnet) |

## System-Specific Rules (C-110)

### The governance boundary — SYSTEM defines + audits; it does NOT enforce or execute
SYSTEM **OWNS**: policy definitions + versioning, actor activation, subscription-tier
capability gating, capability certification (C-94), governance-workflow execution,
violation-response authority, admin audit trail. SYSTEM does **NOT OWN**:
- **Technical enforcement** → each service self-enforces against policy.
- **Business logic** → the domain services.
- **Payment processing** → `tec-payment-service`; **identity** → `tec-auth-service` (§4).

### Read vs write (P6)
The console is **read-only**. Policy/capability/tier **writes** require an **AdminActor
+ mandatory audit trail** (immutable, retained forever) and a **2-person approval for
destructive ops** — those live in the backend governance service (`tec-governance-service`,
C-110 §5), **not in this frontend**. Admin access = CEO authority (C-47).

### Subscription gating (C-110 §5, P0-1)
Feature gating (FREE/PRO/ENTERPRISE) is checked **server-side in BFF routes — never on
the client**. SYSTEM is the authority for the capability→tier map; apps query it.

**Reference of record:** `yasira82/tec-knowledge-base` —
`C-110___SYSTEM_INSTITUTIONAL_CHARTER.md` (charter) + `C-47` (Kernel Spec, policy
source of truth) + `C-94` (capability registry) + `C-123` (session/cookies).

## Architecture Rules (non-negotiable)

### CSRF — middleware ONLY (P2 single source of truth)
CSRF is enforced in **`middleware.ts`** and **nowhere else**: a request is trusted
if the double-submit token matches **OR** it is first-party (Origin host === Host /
`*.tecosystem.app`).
- ❌ **NEVER** add a CSRF check inside a route handler (`csrfCookie !== csrfHeader`
  → 403). It 403's legit Mode-2 payments in Pi Browser (drops `sameSite=None`
  cookies). The CI `payment-policy` job fails the build if you do. (KB C-12 §11)
- ✅ A route may *forward* `x-csrf-token` to a downstream call; it must never *validate* it.

### ADR-007 — Dual-mode payment (Pi foreign session)
Every buy handler MUST guard before touching `window.Pi`:
```typescript
const isHubNavigation = () =>
  document.referrer.toLowerCase().includes('hub.tecosystem.app');
if (isHubNavigation() || !(window as any).Pi || !piReady) {
  redirectToHubPayment(...);   // Mode 1: Hub modal → /hub?pay=1&...
  return;
}
// Mode 2: standalone — createPaymentRecord() then createU2APayment() (src/lib/pi-payment.ts)
```

### ADR-009 — Unified payment contract
`amount` is a **number**; gateway path is **`/api/payment/*`** (singular); the only
inter-service header is **`x-internal-key`** + `INTERNAL_SECRET`. Don't re-declare
payment Zod locally — shapes live in `@yasser172/tec-sdk`.

### Two-SDK boundary
```
Client components → src/lib-client/*  (browser state, Pi hooks)
API routes (BFF)  → @yasser172/tec-sdk via /api/bff/*  (server-only)
```

### Auth / cookies (LOCKED)
SSO via Hub cookies `tec_access_token`, `tec_csrf`, `tec_user`. Never localStorage.
Identity is derived from the `tec_user` cookie server-side — **never from the request body**.

## What's included

```
middleware.ts                              CSRF (double-submit OR Origin) + page guard
src/app/api/auth/sso-callback/route.ts     Hub SSO landing (open-redirect-safe)
src/app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts          token refresh
src/app/api/bff/payment/{create,approve,complete,resolve-incomplete}/route.ts
src/app/api/bff/items/route.ts             example domain route (copy this pattern)
src/app/api/health/route.ts                health endpoint (C-92/C-96) — fail-safe, public, never 500s
src/lib/pi-payment.ts                      createPaymentRecord + createU2APayment
src/lib/pi/PiRuntime.ts                    PAL — single choke-point for window.Pi.* (R1)
src/lib/pi/PiCircuitBreaker.ts             CLOSED→OPEN→HALF_OPEN (3 fails → 60s)
src/lib/flags.ts                           feature flags (NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAG_*) + useFlag
src/lib/observability/logger.ts            structured JSON logger (log.info/warn/error) — no silent failures (C-96)
src/lib/observability/reportError.ts       Sentry-ready error reporter (single swap-point)
src/app/privacy/page.tsx · terms/page.tsx  Pi Portal legal pages
src/styles/tec-design-tokens.css           import in app/layout.tsx
.github/workflows/ci.yml                   payment-policy + CSRF guard + lint/typecheck/test/build
```

**v2 (production-ready by default):** every new app ships
- `/api/health` — uniform C-92 signal (platform health runtime + observability scrape + SLO/runtime-evidence loop);
- structured `log` + `reportError` — use `log.error`/`reportError` in catch blocks (a silent error handler is an invisible failure, C-96; `reportError` is the one place to wire Sentry per app);
- `PiRuntime` (PAL) + `PiCircuitBreaker` — never call `window.Pi.*` directly; go through PiRuntime so an SDK change is a one-file fix (R1) and flapping is contained;
- `flags.ts` — feature flags from day one (`NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAG_<NAME>`);
- coverage gate — `npm run test:coverage` (add devDep `@vitest/coverage-v8`; 60% floor, raise as the app grows).

## New app setup checklist

```
□ package.json: set "name"
□ middleware.ts: adjust PROTECTED_ROUTES
□ sso-callback/route.ts: set ALLOWED_AUDIENCES + DEFAULT_REDIRECT to your domain
□ src/lib/pi-payment.ts + payment/create: set APP_SOURCE slug
□ privacy/page.tsx + terms/page.tsx: set APP / DOMAIN / governing law / contacts
□ Add ADR-007 isHubNavigation() guard to every buy handler
□ .env: API_GATEWAY_URL · INTERNAL_SECRET · SSO_SECRET · NEXT_PUBLIC_PI_APP_ID · PI_SANDBOX=false (prod)
□ Pi Developer Portal: register domain + App ID; set /privacy + /terms URLs
□ Verify a real Pi payment Mode 1 (via Hub) AND Mode 2 (standalone)
```

## What NOT To Do

- Do NOT validate CSRF in a route handler — middleware only (CI blocks it)
- Do NOT send `amount` as a string, or use `/payments` / `x-service-secret`
- Do NOT skip the ADR-007 `isHubNavigation()` guard before `window.Pi`
- Do NOT store tokens in localStorage; do NOT derive identity from the body
- Do NOT add `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` for internal service URLs or `INTERNAL_SECRET`
- Do NOT use an open `redirect` param without the same-origin guard (open redirect)
